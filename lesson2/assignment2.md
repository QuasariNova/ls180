1. What kind of programming language is SQL?

SQL is a "special purpose language." It was built to specifically interact with relational database instead of being of use for generalized purposes. SQL is also a declaritive language. It describes what must be done not how it is done.

2. What are the three sublanguages of SQL?

    1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
    2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
    3. Data Control Language (DCL)

3. Write the following values as quoted string values that could be used in a SQL query.

```

4. What operator is used to concatenate strings?

According to the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/functions-string.html), the `||` operator will concatenate strings like so:

```sql
'Hello ' || 'World' /* 'Hello World'
```

5. What function returns a lowercased version of a string? Write a SQL statement using it.

According to the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/functions-string.html), the `lower()` function will convert the string to lowercase.

```sql
SELECT lower('Oh My GAWSH!');
/*
    lower
--------------
 oh my gawsh!
(1 row)
*/
```

6. How does the `psql` console display true and false values?

It displays true as `t` and false as `f`.

7. The surface area of a sphere is calculated using the formula `A = 4Ï€ r2`, where `A` is the surface area and `r` is the radius of the sphere.

Use SQL to compute the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 26.3cm, truncated to return an integer.

```sql
SELECT trunc(4 * pi() * (26.3 ^ 2)) AS surface_area;
/*
 surface_area
--------------
         8692
(1 row)
*/
```
